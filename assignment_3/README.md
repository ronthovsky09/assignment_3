The following repository is a little interactive data that plots 3PT Percentage against Free Throw Percentage. The data is from nba stats. The size of the plot is based on 3 PT volume or 3PT attempts. You can hover around each point and see the plot point of  each player. The colors of the points are separated by three different positions: guards, centers, and forwards. Generally, most guards have higher percentage of free throws and 3PT percentage since they really on their shooting abilities. The graph also signals a somewhat positive correlation between free throw percentage and 3pt percentage. Further analysis need to be made in order to make such conclusion. 

Enjoy the data visualization!
