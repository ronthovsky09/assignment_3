This is my NBA 3 PT % vs Box Score Plus Minus mini project. I used a simple linear regression to illustrate the importance of the 3PT shot in the current era. Surprisingly, the P Value is around .04, which rejects the null hypothsis of B0 = 0. This suggests that the point line does have profound influence in today's game.
